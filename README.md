5-Step Process to Analyze Frames, Play Footage, and Find the Flag
Step 1: Verify the Extracted Frames
Description: Confirm that the Python script successfully extracted the JPEG frames from stream.raw.
Actions:
Check for the extracted frames in your current directory:
bash

Copy
ls frame_*.jpg
You should see files like frame_0.jpg, frame_1.jpg, etc.
Verify they’re valid JPEGs:
bash

Copy
file frame_0.jpg
Expected output: frame_0.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01 ....
If no frames are found, rerun the script:
bash

Copy
python3 extract_jpegs.py
Count the number of frames to get a sense of the footage length:
bash

Copy
ls frame_*.jpg | wc -l
Step 2: Reconstruct the Footage into a Playable Video
Description: Since you mentioned “plays,” let’s reconstruct the frames into a video file (e.g., MP4) so you can play the security footage and look for the flag.
Actions:
Use ffmpeg to combine the frames into a video:
bash

Copy
ffmpeg -framerate 10 -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p footage.mp4
-framerate 10: Sets the frame rate to 10 frames per second (adjust if the video looks too fast/slow).
frame_%d.jpg: Matches the naming pattern of your frames (frame_0.jpg, frame_1.jpg, etc.).
footage.mp4: Output video file.
Play the video using vlc (or another player like ffplay):
bash

Copy
vlc footage.mp4
Watch the footage for any visible flags, such as a sign in the video showing flag{security_camera}.
